- The library is extremely lightweight and fast.
- The component is described in the most obvious way for a bundle of HTML and Javascript.
- Extremely easy to learn, knowledge of the basics of HTML, Javascript and DOM API is enough.
- The component declaration can be understood by anyone familiar with these basics.

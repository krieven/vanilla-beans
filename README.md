# ![icon](./docs/flower.svg) vanilla-beans

>Thin layer on top of HTML and DOM API, dramatically simplify development of SPA using Vanilla Js style.

## The HTML was created for this again
**vanilla-beans** - a normalized library designed to develop user interfaces of any complexity and dynamism. Provides the ability to create your own components - **beans** and combine them into complex composites, directly using the capabilities of HTML, Javascript and DOM API.

**vanilla-beans** is a thin layer on top of HTML and DOM API, does not create its own environment, does not dictate rules and does not isolate you from the capabilities of the WEB platform. Everything that can be done with HTML and Javascript, can be done with **vanilla-beans** components. 

The component declaration is: HTML for describing the structure of the component and Javascript for describing its behavior.

- The library is extremely lightweight and fast.
- The component is described in the most obvious way for a bundle of HTML and Javascript.
- Extremely easy to learn, knowledge of the basics of HTML, Javascript and DOM API is enough.
- The component declaration can be understood without preparation by anyone familiar with these basics.

- The library and the ideas it is built on are simple and obvious.
